	<p>Hi there! Thanks for visting this webpage. I've created some great memories at the following locations - I hope you can too!</p>

	<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/swimming/Pages/default.aspx">Hampstead Heath Baths </a></h3>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/hampstead-heath/swimming/Pages/default.aspx"><img class="item-img" src="img/heath.jpg" alt="Hampstead Ponds"></a>
	<p>Open-air swimming is internationally famous on Hampstead Heath with our Bathing Ponds and the Parliament Hill Lido. The Ladies' and Men's Ponds are the UK's only lifeguarded open water swimming facilities open to the public every day of the year. The Lido is a 60 x 27 metre uncovered, unheated swimming pool at Parliament Hill.  -  City of London</p>

	<p><span class="tip">Ethan's tip:</span> Never go to the Heath on a sunny day without swimwear...</p>

	<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.streetfeast.com/visit-us/dinerama/">Dinerama</a></h3>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.streetfeast.com/visit-us/dinerama/"><img class="item-img" src="img/dinerama.jpg" alt="Dinerama"></a>
	<p>Open from 5pm until 1am Thursday to Saturday, the split level 1,000 capacity space has a heaving party atmosphere, and is less family friendly than its sister site Hawker House in Canada Water.</p>

	</p>The look on the ground floor is somewhere between a yard and a warehouse, with a resident DJ, four bars and nine global street food traders – including Breddos Tacos and highly rated BBQ specialists Smokestak. Expect to queue for your food and hustle for a place at communal tables.</p>

	<p>Upstairs things are less busy, with five breakout areas for 30 to 200 diners, and four more bars, including the intriguing German Sex Dungeon, which promises craft beer, whisky shots and submission.</p>

	<p>Dinerama is open all year round: from May–September the space is open-air, but from October the site gains a roof, carpet and heating to keep diners warm for the winter. Entrance is free before 7pm, and £3 after that. The venue accepts both cash and card.  -  Timeout</p>

	<p><span class="tip">Ethan's tip: </span>Every food trader is a highlight in this place. A great place to hang out after work or before a night out on the town. </p>
